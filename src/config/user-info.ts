            Hi there!
            I'm a Computer Science student who got into coding back in 8th grade with Java.
            I love diving into tough problems and figuring out solutions (even if it means a bit
            of keyboard smashing). I'm aiming to be a full-stack developer â€” because why choose one
            side when you can do it all?
            <br /><br />
            When I'm not coding, I'm either snapping photos, vibing to music, or hanging out with
            my parrot, who's convinced he's the real star here.
        </>
